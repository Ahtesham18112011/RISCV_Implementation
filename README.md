# Implementation of the [RISC-V](https://github.com/Ahtesham18112011/RISCV_MYTH) core in VSDSquadron FPGA Mini

To implement the Transaction Level - Verilog (TL-Verilog) code to the FPGA is directly not possible we need to first convert the code to Verilog which is done by a software called **Sandpiper SaaS**

## SandPiper SaaS
SandPiper SaaS(Software as a Service) Edition runs [Redwood EDA LLC's](https://www.redwoodeda.com/)  SandPiperâ„¢ TL-Verilog compiler as a microservice in the cloud to support low-overhead and zero-cost open-source development using commercial-grade capabilities. This simple Python script provides a convenient command-line interface to the microservice. Which is also used for implementing a WARP-V or RISC-V core in FPGA
